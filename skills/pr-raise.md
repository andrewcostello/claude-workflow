# PR Raise

Load this skill on `APPROVE` verdict. The skill owns:

1. The human approval gate — fires for Critical risk OR when changed files match the configured financial-paths list
2. PR title and body format
3. Size gates and split criteria
4. The no-attribution rule
5. The `Prepared PR` summary section format for human/dispatcher hand-off

---

## Human Approval Gate

**The gate fires iff either condition holds:**

1. **Risk == Critical** — balance mutations, bet settlement, payout calculations, withdrawals, gambling outcome determination, recovery/retry paths that replay financial or state-mutation operations.
2. **Any changed file matches the financial-paths list** — even when the Tasker classified the change as High (so a wallet payout misclassified as "state machine" still trips the gate by path).

When the gate fires, do NOT raise the PR yourself. Write the `Prepared PR` section into the summary file with everything ready (branch, title, body). The dispatcher in supervised mode prompts the human; in unattended mode it writes `Status: Blocked` with reason "awaiting human PR approval" and moves on. In standalone mode the Tasker prints the Prepared PR section and the human raises it manually.

### Default financial-paths list (evenplay-mono)

```
apps/finance-domain/wallet/**
apps/finance-domain/settlement/**
apps/finance-domain/recovery/**
apps/finance-domain/payout/**
```

The list is configurable via the `$FINANCIAL_PATHS` env var (comma-separated glob patterns) or via `dispatcher run --financial-paths '<patterns>'`. Override in `CLAUDE.md` per project — these defaults assume the wallet / settlement / recovery / payout module layout in this monorepo.

### Why path-based and not just tier-based

Risk tier is the Tasker's classification; the path list is a second deterministic check. The two disagree exactly when they should: a Coder-discovered wallet bug might land in a "state machine" classification (High), but the change still touches money. The path check catches that. Conversely, a state-machine schema change in `apps/platform-domain/bay-session/` is High but is **not** financial — auto-raising it preserves unattended throughput.

---

## Auto-Raise (everything else)

For everything that does not fire the gate above — i.e., High/Medium/Low with no financial-paths file touched — raise the PR immediately on APPROVE. No human pause. Use the title and body format below.

---

## PR Title Format

```
type(scope): [SMG-XXXX] imperative description in present tense
```

Examples:
- `fix(platform): [SMG-1653] resolve bet by hit-bound ID to prevent race condition`
- `feat(wallet): [SMG-1657] add escrow state to prevent silent payout loss`
- `refactor(engine): [SMG-2384] extract round-robin selector into dedicated package`

Keep the title under 70 characters when possible. Imperative mood: "add" / "fix" / "remove" / "refactor", not "added" / "fixes" / "removing".

---

## PR Body Template

```markdown
## What
[One paragraph — what was changed and why it matters.]

## Why
[Root cause or requirement. Reference the Jira ticket: SMG-XXXX. For bug fixes, the root cause comes from the failing-test docstring; see bug-fix-protocol.md.]

## How
[Key implementation decisions — notable patterns, locking strategy, idempotency approach, anything the reviewer would want to flag if it were buried.]

## Test evidence
```
[paste actual test output showing the new tests + the full domain suite passing under -race]
```

## Ticket
SMG-XXXX
```

The PR body is self-contained — a reviewer with no prior context must understand what and why.

---

## PR Rules

- **One PR per ticket** — never bundle multiple tickets.
- **Target `main`.**
- **No unrelated changes** — no reformatting, no style fixes for code you didn't touch.
- **No attribution of any kind** — no "Generated with Claude Code", no "Co-Authored-By", no author names, no tool references. Code and docs belong to the team.
- **PR description is self-contained** — a reviewer with no prior context understands what and why.

## Size Gates

| Lines changed | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| ≤ 250 | Proceed normally |
| 251–500 | Flag to human — confirm scope before raising PR |
| > 500 | Stop — split or get explicit human approval |

If the diff exceeds 500 lines and was not intended to be that large, the Coder bundled scope. Surface this in the summary file's `Key decisions` section so the human can see why.

For tasks that already fire the human gate (Critical or financial-paths-touched), the size gate prompt is folded into that pause — the human sees both the gate context and the size flag together.

---

## Prepared PR Section (gate-fired path)

When you stop at the human approval gate (Critical risk or financial-paths-touched), write this into the summary file under `## PR`:

```markdown
## PR
Prepared, awaiting human approval

### Prepared PR
**Title:** fix(wallet): [SMG-1657] add escrow state to prevent silent payout loss
**Branch:** feat/SMG-1657-escrow-state
**Lines changed:** 187 (within size gate)
**Body:**
```
## What
...

## Why
...

## How
...

## Test evidence
```
[test output]
```

## Ticket
SMG-1657
```
```

The dispatcher, in supervised mode + human approves, runs:

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "<title from summary>" \
  --body-file <(echo "<body from summary>") \
  --base main \
  --head <branch from summary>
```

…captures the URL, and writes `pr_url:` to the YAML row.

In standalone mode (no dispatcher), the Tasker prints the Prepared PR section and lets the human run the `gh` command themselves.

---

## After PR Is Raised

For auto-raise (gate didn't fire) and for dispatcher-completed PRs (gate fired, human approved):

1. Update the summary file `## PR` line to the actual PR URL
2. Set `Status: Done` in the summary
3. Record `final_quality_score` and `deferred_findings_count` from the review consensus

The dispatcher copies these fields into the YAML.

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| PR title missing `[SMG-XXXX]` | Coder forgot the ticket prefix | Reject; rewrite the title before raising |
| PR body has Co-Authored-By or "Generated by" footer | Tool added attribution | Strip before raising; this is the no-attribution rule |
| PR is 800 lines, no advance flag | Coder bundled scope | Either split or get explicit human approval; do not auto-raise |
| PR targets a feature branch, not `main` | Wrong base | Re-target to `main`; never raise PRs against feature branches |
| PR raised when gate should have fired (Critical or financial-path change) | Auto-raise leaked past the gate check | Close the PR with apology comment; do not amend silently |
| Gate fired for a non-financial High task (e.g. state-machine schema) | Mis-applied tier-only logic; path check should have skipped the gate | Update the financial-paths list or fix the check; do not introduce manual overrides |
